   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

:class:`~autoslug.fields.AutoSlugField` is an extended SlugField designed
to automatically avoid duplicate values and apply custom "slugification"
functions (including advanced transliteration).  It is possible to fine-tune
the method for resolving clashes.
