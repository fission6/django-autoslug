Development Workflow
====================

1. File a ticket at Bitbucket (optional).
2. Fork main repository.
3. Write tests and code that passes them. (Check with ./run_tests.py)
4. Document the code: add comments and docstrings so that anyone can easily
   understand what does your code do and why.
5. Ensure that the new code is fully covered with tests.
6. Send pull request.
